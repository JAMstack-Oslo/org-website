JAMstack Oslo is a group for anyone interested in Javascript, static site
generation, markup, git based deployments. If you are a web developer
unfamiliar with git but wanting to move away from FTP, this is also for you!

The intention of this [user group][2] is to nurture and grow a Oslo chapter of
the [JAMstack][3] community. If you would like to help out, please see [reach
out](about/contact.html).

## What is the JAMstack?

JAMstack is a modern approach to building web sites that has the following properties.

* JavaScript - Decoupled front- and back-end
* API - All backend interaction are handled through API calls
* Markup - Serve statically generated HTML
