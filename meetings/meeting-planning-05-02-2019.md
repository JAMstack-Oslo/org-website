It focuses on keeping anyone interested in [JAMstack Oslo][7] up to date.

Today's planning meeting was done via chat with Knut Melvær and myself. This
turned out to be easier for note taking since it's basically transcribed. Why
did we not do this earlier?

The topics for today were:

## Status on February

I summarized the progress on speaker invitations. Check the [Discord server][8]
for details ;) Basically we are still missing bio text and talk abstract. These
should be added to the event page soon. I will follow up.

## Website feedback

A few people have suggested adding a blog to this site. The reasoning behind
it was getting more content on the page so we would rank higher. Currently
[Meetup.com][7] is at the top of search results which is fine.  The way we
measure how good it's going is by the count of people showing up to events
anyways. Our website is only meant for basic information like links to Meetup,
Discord, etc.  The main content here is for people who may want to help us in
organizing events and build out the organization team.

While there is nothing wrong with a blog we feel that it should be less of a
focus.  We could add a blogs section where it could link to specific blog posts
from the community though. This is a low priority.

Someone also noted that the website was lacking in personality or own style (if
I understood it correctly). When we get a new Meetup logo we can create our own
Vuepress theme to be consistent. It should be easy to fix.


## Feedback from last time

So we have not really received event specific feedback yet. Maybe it's still
too early?

Should we try to be on more channels than just Twitter and Discord? Is it worth
creating Facebook and Instagram accounts for the user group? [What do you
think?][9]
