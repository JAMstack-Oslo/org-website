# Contact us

There are several avenues to getting in touch. We try to be very accessible
and someone is usually checking the [Discord][0] server frequently.

### In person

Physical planning meetings are scheduled on demand. If you prefer in person
then attending the next meetup might be better, see [Meetup.com][2] for dates.

### Monthly conference calls

You can attend the community conference call on the 5th every month from 7PM to
8PM in the [#monthly-planning][0] channel on [Discord][0].

If you are new to Discord or use the website, please [download][5] the desktop
or mobile app beforehand to avoid any audio issues. Thanks!

### Chat

As mentioned above we a have a [Discord][0] server setup for real-time
interactions. We have a chat channel [#planning][8] which is the coordination
point for inviting speakers. We share notes and progress in there. If you like
to stay up to date then this is the right place for you.

### Misc
